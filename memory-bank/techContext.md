## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Next.js App Router

- Chosen for its server component support and improved rendering options
- Enables a mix of static, server-rendered, and client components
- Provides built-in API routes and middleware support

### 2. AWS Amplify Gen 2

- Selected for streamlined AWS service integration
- TypeScript-first approach with improved developer experience
- Better separation of frontend and backend code
- Infrastructure as code using CDK constructs

### 3. GraphQL with AppSync

- Provides flexible data querying capabilities
- Real-time data with subscriptions when needed
- Strong typing with schema definition
- Direct integration with DynamoDB

### 4. Authentication Strategy

- Amazon Cognito for user management
- Custom UI components for auth flows
- JWT token-based authentication
- Post-authentication Lambda triggers for user setup

### 5. Component Architecture

- Atomic design principles
- Clear separation between UI and business logic
- Comprehensive test coverage for components
- Reusable patterns across the application

### 6. MCP Server Integration

- Model Context Protocol server for AI assistant integration
- Provides access to prompt repository via GraphQL API
- Configuration page for easy setup
- API key authentication for secure access

## Technical Constraints

### 1. AWS Ecosystem Integration

- All services must integrate well with AWS
- Authentication must use Cognito
- Data storage must use DynamoDB

### 2. Performance Requirements

- Initial page load under 2 seconds
- Time to interactive under 3 seconds
- Optimized bundle sizes
- Efficient data fetching patterns

### 3. Security Requirements

- HTTPS for all communications
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Input validation for all user inputs
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities

### 4. Scalability Considerations

- DynamoDB capacity planning
- AppSync request throttling
- Lambda concurrency limits
- CDN for static assets

## Dependencies and External Services

### Core Dependencies

- AWS Amplify libraries for backend integration
- Next.js for frontend framework
- React for UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zod for validation

### External Services
