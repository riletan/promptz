# Promptz Project Intelligence

## Coding Patterns

### File Organization

- Next.js App Router structure is used with app/ directory containing all routes
- UI components are organized in app/ui/ with subdirectories by feature
- Shared components are in components/ui/
- Tests are co-located with components in **tests** directories
- Amplify configuration is in amplify/ directory

### Naming Conventions

- React components use PascalCase (e.g., PromptCard.tsx)
- Utility functions and files use kebab-case (e.g., error-message.tsx)
- Test files are named after the component with .test.tsx suffix
- Server actions are in app/lib/actions/ directory

### Component Structure

- UI components are organized by feature (auth, prompts, navigation)
- Components use TypeScript for type safety
- Form components use React Hook Form with Zod validation
- Components have corresponding test files with snapshots

### Styling Approach

- Tailwind CSS is used for styling
- Class names use tailwind-merge for conditional styling
- Dark mode support via next-themes
- Custom UI components built on Radix UI primitives

## Development Workflow

### Local Development

- Use `npm run dev` to start the development server
- Changes to backend require `npm run sandbox` to deploy
- Tests are run with `npm run test`
- Pull requests should pass `npm run pr` (lint + tests)

### AWS Integration

- AWS credentials must be configured for Amplify
- Sandbox environment uses `PROMPTZ_ENV=sandbox` flag
- AppSync provides GraphQL API for data access
- DynamoDB is used for data storage

### Testing Strategy

- Jest and React Testing Library for component tests
- Snapshot tests for UI components
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Mock AWS services in tests

## User Experience Patterns

### Authentication Flow

- Login and signup forms with validation
- Error messages displayed inline with form fields
- Password reset flow with email confirmation
- Protected routes redirect to login

### MCP Server Integration

- MCP server configuration page provides API URL and API Key
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality for configuration details
- Configuration snippet for easy setup in MCP settings
- Dark theme UI for better readability of configuration details

### Prompt Management

- Prompts have title, description, instruction, and optional howto
- Tags categorize prompts by SDLC activity, interface, and category
- Editing is restricted to prompt owners
- Copy to clipboard functionality for prompt instructions
- Draft system allows saving work-in-progress prompts
- Form validation using Zod schema ensures data quality
- Search functionality supports case-insensitive text search across name and description
- Filtering system allows filtering by tags, categories, SDLC activities, and interfaces

### Navigation

- Top navigation with authentication state awareness
- Mobile menu for responsive design
- User menu for authenticated users
- Theme toggle for light/dark mode

## Project Preferences

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer server components where possible
- Use server actions for data mutations

### Documentation

- Code should be self-documenting with clear naming
- Complex logic should have comments explaining the approach
- Tests serve as documentation for component behavior
- README provides project overview and setup instructions

### Performance Considerations

- Optimize component rendering with proper React patterns
- Use server components for data fetching where possible
- Minimize client-side JavaScript
- Optimize images and assets

## Common Challenges

### Authentication Edge Cases

- Token refresh handling
- Error state management
- Social provider integration

### Data Fetching

- Error handling in server actions
- Revalidation strategies
- Optimistic updates

### Code Migration

- Some files like app/prompt/create/page.tsx still reference old component structure
- References to @cloudscape-design/components need to be updated to use the new UI components
- Old repository pattern needs to be migrated to use server actions

### Form Handling

- Form validation using React Hook Form with Zod schemas
- Complex validation with custom error messages
- Form state management with useActionState hook
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality for sharing configuration and code snippets

### Search and Filtering

- Text search uses case variations (lowercase, uppercase, capitalized) for better matching
- Filter conditions are built using a consistent pattern with FilterCondition type
- Tag-based filtering supports both single tags and arrays of tags
- Search parameters are validated using Zod schema
- Filters can be combined (text search + tags + categories)
- Sort options include creation date (ascending/descending)

### Draft System

- Drafts are stored separately from published prompts
- Draft names are suffixed with "[DRAFT]" for easy identification
- Drafts share the same ID as their corresponding prompts
- When updating a prompt, any associated draft is deleted
- Draft saving is non-blocking and provides toast notifications

## Future Considerations

### Scalability

- Monitor DynamoDB capacity
- Consider caching strategies as data grows
- Plan for increased user authentication load
- Prepare for MCP server scaling as adoption increases

### Feature Expansion

- Community features (comments, ratings)
- Advanced search and filtering
- Analytics and insights
- Integration capabilities
- Enhanced MCP server features (custom tools, resource templates)
